	title: "Down the Rabbit-Hole",
	position: 0,
	content: "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversations?’<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p><p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit <em>actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p><p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.</p><p>‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)</p><p>Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)</p><p>Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’</p><p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p><p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p><p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p><p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p><p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.</p><p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p><p>It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p><p>However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.</p><p>*    *    *    *    *    *    *</p><p>*    *    *    *    *    *</p><p>*    *    *    *    *    *    *</p><p>‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’</p><p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p><p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p><p>‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’</p><p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’</p><p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p><p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p><p>*    *    *    *    *    *    *</p><p>*    *    *    *    *    *</p><p>*    *    *    *    *    *    *</p>"

	title: "A Mad Tea Party",
	position: 1,
	content: " There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’<p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: ‘No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice coming. ‘There’s plenty of room!’ said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p><p>‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p><p>Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. ‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.</p><p>‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.</p><p>‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.</p><p>‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,’ said the March Hare.</p><p>‘I didn’t know it was your table,’ said Alice; ‘it’s laid for a great many more than three.’</p><p>‘Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.</p><p>‘You should learn not to make personal remarks,’ Alice said with some severity; ‘it’s very rude.’</p><p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, ‘Why is a raven like a writing-desk?’</p><p>‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,’ she added aloud.</p><p>‘Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’ said the March Hare.</p><p>‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.</p><p>‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went on.</p><p>‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.’</p><p>‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. ‘You might just as well say that “I see what I eat” is the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’</p><p>‘You might just as well say,’ added the March Hare, ‘that “I like what I get” is the same thing as “I get what I like”!’</p><p>‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, ‘that “I breathe when I sleep” is the same thing as “I sleep when I breathe”!’</p><p>‘It is the same thing with you,’ said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn’t much.</p><p>The Hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘What day of the month is it?’ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p><p>Alice considered a little, and then said ‘The fourth.’</p><p>‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the Hatter. ‘I told you butter wouldn’t suit the works!’ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.</p><p>‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.</p><p>‘Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,’ the Hatter grumbled: ‘you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.’</p><p>The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, ‘It was the best butter, you know.’</p><p>Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. ‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked. ‘It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t tell what o’clock it is!’</p><p>‘Why should it?’ muttered the Hatter. ‘Does your watch tell you what year it is?’</p><p>‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but that’s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.’</p><p>‘Which is just the case with mine,’ said the Hatter.</p><p>Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.</p><p>‘The Dormouse is asleep again,’ said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.</p><p>The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, ‘Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.’</p><p>‘Have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.</p><p>‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the answer?’</p><p>‘I haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the Hatter.</p><p>‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.</p><p>Alice sighed wearily. ‘I think you might do something better with the time,’ she said, ‘than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.’</p><p>‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s him.’</p><p>‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.</p><p>‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. ‘I dare say you never even spoke to Time!’</p><p>‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied: ‘but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.’</p><p>‘Ah! that accounts for it,’ said the Hatter. ‘He won’t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!’</p><p>(‘I only wish it was,’ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)</p><p>‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said Alice thoughtfully: ‘but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’</p><p>‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.’</p><p>‘Is that the way you manage?’ Alice asked.</p><p>The Hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ he replied. ‘We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—’ (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) ‘—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing <blockquote>\"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!<br />How I wonder what you’re at!\"</blockquote></p><p>You know the song, perhaps?’</p><p>‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice."

	title: "The Garden of Live Flowers",
	position: 2,
	content: "<p>‘I should see the garden far better,’ said Alice to herself, ‘if I could get to the top of that hill: and here’s a path that leads straight to it—at least, no, it doesn’t do that—’ (after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), ‘but I suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It’s more like a corkscrew than a path! Well,<em>this</em> turn goes to the hill, I suppose—no, it doesn’t! This goes straight back to the house! Well then, I’ll try it the other way.’</p><p>And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop herself.</p><p>‘It’s no use talking about it,’ Alice said, looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her. ‘I’m <em>not</em> going in again yet. I know I should have to get through the Looking-glass again—back into the old room—and there’d be an end of all my adventures!’</p><p>So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, ‘I really <em>shall</em> doit this time—’ when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself(as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door.</p><p>‘Oh, it’s too bad!’ she cried. ‘I never saw such a house for getting in the way! Never!’</p><p>However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.</p><p>‘O Tiger-lily,’ said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind, ‘I <em>wish</em> you could talk!’</p><p>‘We <em>can</em> talk,’ said the Tiger-lily: ‘when there’s anybody worth talking to.’</p><p>Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice—almost in a whisper.‘And can <em>all</em> the flowers talk?’</p><p>‘As well as <em>you</em> can,’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘And a great deal louder.’</p><p>‘It isn’t manners for us to begin, you know,’ said the Rose, ‘and I really was wondering when you’d speak! Said I to myself, “Her face has got <em>some</em>sense in it, though it’s not a clever one!” Still, you’re the right colour, and that goes a long way.’</p><p>‘I don’t care about the colour,’ the Tiger-lily remarked. ‘If only herpetals curled up a little more, she’d be all right.’</p><p>Alice didn’t like being criticised, so she began asking questions. ‘Aren’t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you?’</p><p>‘There’s the tree in the middle,’ said the Rose: ‘what else is it goodfor?’</p><p>‘But what could it do, if any danger came?’ Alice asked.</p><p>‘It says “Bough-wough!”’ cried a Daisy: ‘that’s why its branches are called boughs!’</p><p>‘Didn’t you know <em>that</em>?’ cried another Daisy, and here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices.‘Silence, every one of you!’ cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. ‘They know I can’t get at them!’ it panted, bending its quivering head towards Alice,‘or they wouldn’t dare to do it!’</p><p>‘Never mind!’ Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, ‘If you don’t hold your tongues, I’ll pick you!’</p><p>There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white.</p><p>‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘The daisies are worst of all. When one speaks, they all begin together, and it’s enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on!’</p><p>‘How is it you can all talk so nicely?’ Alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. ‘I’ve been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.’</p><p>‘Put your hand down, and feel the ground,’ said the Tiger-lily. ‘Then you’ll know why.’</p><p>Alice did so. ‘It’s very hard,’ she said, ‘but I don’t see what that has to do with it.’</p><p>‘In most gardens,’ the Tiger-lily said, ‘they make the beds too soft—so that the flowers are always asleep.’</p><p>This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it.‘I never thought of that before!’ she said.</p><p>‘It’s <em>my</em> opinion that you never think <em>at all</em>,’ the Rose said in a rather severe tone.</p><p>‘I never saw anybody that looked stupider,’ a Violet said, so suddenly,that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn’t spoken before.</p><p>‘Hold <em>your</em> tongue!’ cried the Tiger-lily. ‘As if <em>you</em> ever saw anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know nomore what’s going on in the world, than if you were a bud!’</p><p>‘Are there any more people in the garden besides me?’ Alice said, not choosing to notice the Rose’s last remark.</p><p>‘There’s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,’said the Rose. ‘I wonder how you do it—’ (‘You’re always wondering,’said the Tiger-lily), ‘but she’s more bushy than you are.’</p><p>‘Is she like me?’ Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,‘There’s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!’</p><p>‘Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,’ the Rose said, ‘but she’s redder—and her petals are shorter, I think.’</p><p>‘Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,’ the Tiger-lily interrupted: ‘not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.’</p><p>‘But that’s not <em>your</em> fault,’ the Rose added kindly: ‘you’re beginning to fade, you know—and then one can’t help one’s petals getting a little untidy.’</p><p>Alice didn’t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked ‘Does she ever come out here?’</p><p>‘I daresay you’ll see her soon,’ said the Rose. ‘She’s one of the thorny kind.’</p><p>‘Where does she wear the thorns?’ Alice asked with some curiosity.</p><p>‘Why all round her head, of course,’ the Rose replied. ‘I was wondering<em>you</em> hadn’t got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.’</p><p>‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur. ‘I hear her footstep, thump, thump,thump, along the gravel-walk!’</p><p>Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. ‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high—and here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!</p><p>‘It’s the fresh air that does it,’ said the Rose: ‘wonderfully fine air it is, out here.’</p><p>‘I think I’ll go and meet her,’ said Alice, for, though the flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real Queen.</p><p>‘You can’t possibly do that,’ said the Rose: ‘<em>I</em> should advise youto walk the other way.’</p><p>This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.</p><p>A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.</p><p>It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at.</p><p>‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen. ‘And where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers all the time.’</p><p>Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her way.</p><p>‘I don’t know what you mean by <em>your</em> way,’ said the Queen: ‘all the ways about here belong to <em>me</em>—but why did you come out here at all?’ she added in a kinder tone. ‘Curtsey while you’re thinking what to say, it saves time.’</p><p>Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the Queento disbelieve it. ‘I’ll try it when I go home,’ she thought to herself,‘the next time I’m a little late for dinner.’</p><p>‘It’s time for you to answer now,’ the Queen said, looking at her watch:‘open your mouth a <em>little</em> wider when you speak, and always say “your Majesty.”’</p><p>‘I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty—’</p><p>‘That’s right,’ said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice didn’t like at all, ‘though, when you say “garden,”—<em>I’ve</em> seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.’</p><p>Alice didn’t dare to argue the point, but went on: ‘—and I thought I’d try and find my way to the top of that hill—’</p><p>‘When you say “hill,”’ the Queen interrupted, ‘<em>I</em> could show you hills, in comparison with which you’d call that a valley.’</p><p>‘No, I shouldn’t,’ said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:‘a hill <em>can’t</em> be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense—’</p><p>The Red Queen shook her head, ‘You may call it “nonsense” if you like,’she said, ‘but <em>I’ve</em> heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!’</p><p>Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen’s tone that shewas a <em>little</em> offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill.</p><p>For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country—and a most curious country it was. There were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.</p><p>‘I declare it’s marked out just like a large chessboard!’ Alice said at last. ‘There ought to be some men moving about somewhere—and so there are!’ She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. ‘It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world—if this <em>is</em> the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I <em>wish</em> I was one of them! I wouldn’t mind being a Pawn, if only I might join—though of course I should <em>like</em> to be a Queen, best.’</p><p>She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, ‘That’s easily managed. You can be the White Queen’s Pawn, if you like, as Lily’s too young to play; and you’re in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to the Eighth Square you’ll be a Queen—’ Just at this moment, somehow or other,they began to run.</p><p>Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying ‘Faster! Faster!’ but Alice felt she <em>could not</em> go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.</p><p>The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. ‘I wonder if all the things move along with us?’ thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, ‘Faster! Don’t try to talk!’</p><p>Not that Alice had any idea of doing <em>that</em>. She felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still the Queen cried ‘Faster! Faster!’ and dragged her along. ‘Are we nearly there?’ Alice managed to pant out at last.</p><p>‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated. ‘Why, we passed it ten minutes ago!Faster!’ And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in Alice’s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.</p><p>‘Now! Now!’ cried the Queen. ‘Faster! Faster!’ And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite exhausted,they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy.</p><p>The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, ‘You may rest a little now.’</p><p>Alice looked round her in great surprise. ‘Why, I do believe we’ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!’</p><p>‘Of course it is,’ said the Queen, ‘what would you have it?’</p><p>‘Well, in <em>our</em> country,’ said Alice, still panting a little, ‘you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.’</p><p>‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, <em>here</em>, you see, it takes all the running <em>you</em> can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’</p><p>‘I’d rather not try, please!’ said Alice. ‘I’m quite content to stay here—onlyI <em>am</em> so hot and thirsty!’</p><p>‘I know what <em>you’d</em> like!’ the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. ‘Have a biscuit?’</p><p>Alice thought it would not be civil to say ‘No,’ though it wasn’t at all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was <em>very</em> dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in allher life.</p><p>‘While you’re refreshing yourself,’ said the Queen, ‘I’ll just take the measurements.’ And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches,and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here andthere.</p><p>‘At the end of two yards,’ she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, ‘I shall give you your directions—have another biscuit?’</p><p>‘No, thank you,’ said Alice: ‘one’s <em>quite</em> enough!’</p><p>‘Thirst quenched, I hope?’ said the Queen.</p><p>Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not wait for an answer, but went on. ‘At the end of <em>three</em> yards I shall repeat them—forfear of your forgetting them. At the end of <em>four</em>, I shall say good-bye.And at the end of <em>five</em>, I shall go!’</p><p>She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the row.</p><p>At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, ‘A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. So you’ll go <em>very</em> quickly through the Third Square—by railway, I should think—and you’ll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, <em>that</em> square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee—the Fifth is mostly water—the Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty—But you make no remark?’</p><p>‘I—I didn’t know I had to make one—just then,’ Alice faltered out.</p><p>‘You <em>should</em> have said, “It’s extremely kind of you to tell me all this”—however,we’ll suppose it said—the Seventh Square is all forest—however,one of the Knights will show you the way—and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it’s all feasting and fun!’ Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.</p><p>At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, ‘Speak in French when you can’t think of the English for a thing—turn out your toes as you walk—and remember who you are!’ She did not wait for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, whereshe turned for a moment to say ‘good-bye,’ and then hurried on to the last.</p><p>How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood (‘and she <em>can</em> run very fast!’ thought Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.</p>"

	title: "Humpty Dumpty",
	position: 3,
	content: "<p> However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human: when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself. ‘It can’t be anybody else!’ she said to herself. ‘I’m as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.’ </p><p> It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wall—such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance—and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didn’t take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all. </p><p> ‘And how exactly like an egg he is!’ she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall. </p><p> ‘It’s <em>very</em> provoking,’ Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, ‘to be called an egg—<em>Very!</em>’ </p><p> ‘I said you <em>looked</em> like an egg, Sir,’ Alice gently explained. ‘And some eggs are very pretty, you know’ she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment. </p><p> ‘Some people,’ said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, ‘have no more sense than a baby!’ </p><p> Alice didn’t know what to say to this: it wasn’t at all like conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to <em>her</em>; in fact, his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree—so she stood and softly repeated to herself:— </p><blockquote> ‘Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:<br/> Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<br/> All the King’s horses and all the King’s men<br/> Couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.’</blockquote> <p> ‘That last line is much too long for the poetry,’ she added, almost out loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her. </p><p> ‘Don’t stand there chattering to yourself like that,’ Humpty Dumpty said, looking at her for the first time, ‘but tell me your name and your business.’ </p><p> ‘My <em>name</em> is Alice, but—’ </p><p> ‘It’s a stupid enough name!’ Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently. ‘What does it mean?’ </p><p> ‘<em>Must</em> a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully. </p><p> ‘Of course it must,’ Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: ‘<em>my</em> name means the shape I am—and a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.’ </p><p> ‘Why do you sit out here all alone?’ said Alice, not wishing to begin an argument. </p><p> ‘Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty. ‘Did you think I didn’t know the answer to <em>that</em>? Ask another.’ </p><p> ‘Don’t you think you’d be safer down on the ground?’ Alice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured anxiety for the queer creature. ‘That wall is so <em>very</em> narrow!’ </p><p> ‘What tremendously easy riddles you ask!’ Humpty Dumpty growled out. ‘Of course I don’t think so! Why, if ever I <em>did</em> fall off—which there’s no chance of—but <em>if</em> I did—’ Here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. ‘<em>If</em> I did fall,’ he went on, ‘<em>The King has promised me—with his very own mouth</em>—to—to—’ </p><p> ‘To send all his horses and all his men,’ Alice interrupted, rather unwisely. </p><p> ‘Now I declare that’s too bad!’ Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion. ‘You’ve been listening at doors—and behind trees—and down chimneys—or you couldn’t have known it!’ </p><p> ‘I haven’t, indeed!’ Alice said very gently. ‘It’s in a book.’ </p><p> ‘Ah, well! They may write such things in a <em>book</em>,’ Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone. ‘That’s what you call a History of England, that is. Now, take a good look at me! I’m one that has spoken to a King, <em>I</em> am: mayhap you’ll never see such another: and to show you I’m not proud, you may shake hands with me!’ And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she took it. ‘If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind,’ she thought: ‘and then I don’t know what would happen to his head! I’m afraid it would come off!’ </p><p> ‘Yes, all his horses and all his men,’ Humpty Dumpty went on. ‘They’d pick me up again in a minute, <em>they</em> would! However, this conversation is going on a little too fast: let’s go back to the last remark but one.’ </p><p> ‘I’m afraid I can’t quite remember it,’ Alice said very politely. </p><p> ‘In that case we start fresh,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘and it’s my turn to choose a subject—’ (‘He talks about it just as if it was a game!’ thought Alice.) ‘So here’s a question for you. How old did you say you were?’ </p><p> Alice made a short calculation, and said ‘Seven years and six months.’ </p><p> ‘Wrong!’ Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. ‘You never said a word like it!’ </p><p> ‘I though you meant “How old <em>are</em> you?”’ Alice explained. </p><p> ‘If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty. </p><p> Alice didn’t want to begin another argument, so she said nothing. </p><p> ‘Seven years and six months!’ Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. ‘An uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you’d asked <em>my</em> advice, I’d have said “Leave off at seven”—but it’s too late now.’ </p><p> ‘I never ask advice about growing,’ Alice said indignantly. </p><p> ‘Too proud?’ the other inquired. </p><p> Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. ‘I mean,’ she said, ‘that one can’t help growing older.’ </p><p> ‘<em>One</em> can’t, perhaps,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘but <em>two</em> can. With proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.’ </p><p> ‘What a beautiful belt you’ve got on!’ Alice suddenly remarked. </p><p> (They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.) ‘At least,’ she corrected herself on second thoughts, ‘a beautiful cravat, I should have said—no, a belt, I mean—I beg your pardon!’ she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she hadn’t chosen that subject. ‘If I only knew,’ she thought to herself, ‘which was neck and which was waist!’ </p><p> Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or two. When he <em>did</em> speak again, it was in a deep growl. </p><p> ‘It is a—<em>most—provoking</em>—thing,’ he said at last, ‘when a person doesn’t know a cravat from a belt!’ </p><p> ‘I know it’s very ignorant of me,’ Alice said, in so humble a tone that Humpty Dumpty relented. </p><p> ‘It’s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It’s a present from the White King and Queen. There now!’ </p><p> ‘Is it really?’ said Alice, quite pleased to find that she <em>had</em> chosen a good subject, after all. </p><p> ‘They gave it me,’ Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, ‘they gave it me—for an un-birthday present.’ </p><p> ‘I beg your pardon?’ Alice said with a puzzled air. </p><p> ‘I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty. </p><p> ‘I mean, what <em>is</em> an un-birthday present?’ </p><p> ‘A present given when it isn’t your birthday, of course.’ </p><p> Alice considered a little. ‘I like birthday presents best,’ she said at last. </p><p> ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about!’ cried Humpty Dumpty. ‘How many days are there in a year?’ </p><p> ‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice. </p><p> ‘And how many birthdays have you?’ </p><p> ‘One.’ </p><p> ‘And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains?’ </p><p> ‘Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.’ </p><p> Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. ‘I’d rather see that done on paper,’ he said. </p><p> Alice couldn’t help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and worked the sum for him: </p><blockquote> 365<br/> 1<br/> ____<br/> 364<br/> ___</blockquote> <p> Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. ‘That seems to be done right—’ he began. </p><p> ‘You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted. </p><p> ‘To be sure I was!’ Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for him. ‘I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that <em>seems</em> to be done right—though I haven’t time to look it over thoroughly just now—and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents—’ </p><p> ‘Certainly,’ said Alice. </p><p> ‘And only <em>one</em> for birthday presents, you know. There’s glory for you!’ </p><p> ‘I don’t know what you mean by “glory,”’ Alice said. </p><p> Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. ‘Of course you don’t—till I tell you. I meant “there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!”’ </p><p> ‘But “glory” doesn’t mean “a nice knock-down argument,”’ Alice objected. </p><p> ‘When <em>I</em> use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.’ </p><p> ‘The question is,’ said Alice, ‘whether you <em>can</em> make words mean so many different things.’ </p><p> ‘The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘which is to be master—that’s all.’ </p><p> Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. ‘They’ve a temper, some of them—particularly verbs, they’re the proudest—adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs—however, <em>I</em> can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability! That’s what <em>I</em> say!’ </p><p> ‘Would you tell me, please,’ said Alice ‘what that means?’ </p><p> ‘Now you talk like a reasonable child,’ said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased. ‘I meant by “impenetrability” that we’ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you’d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don’t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.’ </p><p> ‘That’s a great deal to make one word mean,’ Alice said in a thoughtful tone. </p><p> ‘When I make a word do a lot of work like that,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘I always pay it extra.’ </p><p> ‘Oh!’ said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark. </p><p> ‘Ah, you should see ‘em come round me of a Saturday night,’ Humpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: ‘for to get their wages, you know.’ </p><p> (Alice didn’t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I can’t tell <em>you</em>.) </p><p> ‘You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,’ said Alice. ‘Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called “Jabberwocky”?’ </p><p> ‘Let’s hear it,’ said Humpty Dumpty. ‘I can explain all the poems that were ever invented—and a good many that haven’t been invented just yet.’ </p><p> This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse: </p><blockquote> ‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/> Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br/> All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/> And the mome raths outgrabe.</blockquote> <p> ‘That’s enough to begin with,’ Humpty Dumpty interrupted: ‘there are plenty of hard words there. “<em>Brillig</em>” means four o’clock in the afternoon—the time when you begin <em>broiling</em> things for dinner.’ </p><p> ‘That’ll do very well,’ said Alice: ‘and “<em>slithy</em>”?’ </p><p> ‘Well, “<em>slithy</em>” means “lithe and slimy.” “Lithe” is the same as “active.” You see it’s like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.’ </p><p> ‘I see it now,’ Alice remarked thoughtfully: ‘and what are “<em>toves</em>”?’ </p><p> ‘Well, “<em>toves</em>” are something like badgers—they’re something like lizards—and they’re something like corkscrews.’ </p><p> ‘They must be very curious looking creatures.’ </p><p> ‘They are that,’ said Humpty Dumpty: ‘also they make their nests under sun-dials—also they live on cheese.’ </p><p> ‘And what’s the “<em>gyre</em>” and to “<em>gimble</em>”?’ </p><p> ‘To “<em>gyre</em>” is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To “<em>gimble</em>” is to make holes like a gimlet.’ </p><p> ‘And “<em>the wabe</em>” is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?’ said Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity. </p><p> ‘Of course it is. It’s called “<em>wabe</em>,” you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it—’ </p><p> ‘And a long way beyond it on each side,’ Alice added. </p><p> ‘Exactly so. Well, then, “<em>mimsy</em>” is “flimsy and miserable” (there’s another portmanteau for you). And a “<em>borogove</em>” is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round—something like a live mop.’ </p><p> ‘And then “<em>mome raths</em>”?’ said Alice. ‘I’m afraid I’m giving you a great deal of trouble.’ </p><p> ‘Well, a “<em>rath</em>” is a sort of green pig: but “<em>mome</em>” I’m not certain about. I think it’s short for “from home”—meaning that they’d lost their way, you know.’ </p><p> ‘And what does “<em>outgrabe</em>” mean?’ </p><p> ‘Well, “<em>outgrabing</em>” is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you’ll hear it done, maybe—down in the wood yonder—and when you’ve once heard it you’ll be <em>quite</em> content. Who’s been repeating all that hard stuff to you?’ </p><p> ‘I read it in a book,’ said Alice. ‘But I had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by—Tweedledee, I think it was.’ </p><p> ‘As to poetry, you know,’ said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, ‘<em>I</em> can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that—’ </p><p> ‘Oh, it needn’t come to that!’ Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning. </p><p> ‘The piece I’m going to repeat,’ he went on without noticing her remark, ‘was written entirely for your amusement.’ </p><p> Alice felt that in that case she really <em>ought</em> to listen to it, so she sat down, and said ‘Thank you’ rather sadly. </p>"
